             <p>Major Dhyan Chand (29 August 1905 – 3 December 1979) was an Indian field hockey player widely regarded as one of the greatest in the history of the sport. Star of the Indian hockey team that dominated the sport in the years before World War II, the prolific Dhyan Chand played a key role in India’s three consecutive gold hauls at the Olympic Games - in 1928, 1932 and 1936.</p>
             <p>His influence extended beyond these victories, as India won the field hockey event in seven out of eight Olympics from 1928 to 1964, he scored 570 goals in 185 matches according to his autobiography, <i>Goal</i>.</p>
              <br><p>It is said that once his sublime skill and close control of the ball aroused such suspicion that his stick was broken to see whether there was a magnet inside. Such was Dhyan Chand’s mastery of the game and so dazzling was his ball control that he earned the epithets 'Hockey Wizard' and 'The Magician'.</p>
              <p>The Government of India awarded Chand India's third highest civilian honour of Padma Bhushan in 1956. His birthday, 29 August, is celebrated as National Sports Day in India every year. India's highest sporting honour <i>Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award</i> is named after him.</p>
